# Facial-Expression-Recognition
We created and deployed the Convolutional Neural Network for performing our image classification task. Our task basically consisted of recognition of emotion from human images and Deep CNN have been found to accomplish the task quite effectively. Moreover various researches have proved CNN to be an effective method for carrying out image classification jobs.

# Facial-Expression-Recognition
We created and deployed the Convolutional Neural Network for performing our image classification task. Our task basically consisted of recognition of emotion from human images and Deep CNN have been found to accomplish the task quite effectively. Moreover various researches have proved CNN to be an effective method for carrying out image classification jobs.

#### For a detailed explanation of how everything is happening in this project, please refer to minor project report document uploaded in word format.

## Getting the dataset
You can obtain the dataset from the following link.(https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) . If they want a login for download ,just create an account for that and then you'll be able to do so.

## Model Architecture
The complete overview of what all layers are involved in the creation of the CNN is present in this Folder.

## Model Performance
The performance of the model on various emotions is mentioned. There are Basically six emotions
* Anger
* Fear
* Happy
* Sad
* Surprise
* Neutral

## Testing Images
I've also provided some testing images for the model to test on so that you can also judge the performance yourself.
